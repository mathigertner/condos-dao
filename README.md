# Condos DAO - Zero-Knowledge Governance Platform

A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) platform designed for condominium governance with privacy-preserving voting using zero-knowledge proofs.

## 🏗️ Project Overview

This project implements a complete DAO infrastructure that allows condominium residents to:

- Create and manage proposals
- Vote anonymously using zero-knowledge proofs (ZK)
- Manage financial obligations and debt distribution
- Maintain transparent governance while preserving voter privacy

## 🔧 Smart Contracts

1. **DAO.sol** - Main governance contract with proposal management and anonymous voting
2. **DAOFactory.sol** - DAO deployment factory using minimal proxy pattern (EIP-1167)
3. **SemaphoreDeployer.sol** - Semaphore infrastructure deployer
4. **Vault.sol** - Treasury management

## 🛡️ Key Features

- **Anonymous Voting**: Members can vote without revealing their identity using Semaphore ZK proofs
- **Role-Based Access**: Admin, Proposer, and Member roles with different permissions
- **Financial Management**: Debt distribution and payment tracking
- **Gas Efficient**: 96.5% gas savings using minimal proxy pattern for DAO deployment

## 🏭 EIP-1167 Minimal Proxy Pattern

This project uses the **Minimal Proxy Clone pattern (EIP-1167)** for extremely gas-efficient DAO deployment:

- **How it works**: Instead of deploying the full contract code multiple times, it creates lightweight "proxy" contracts that delegate all calls to a single implementation contract
- **Gas savings**: Each new DAO costs only ~45K gas instead of ~3M gas (96.5% savings)
- **Isolated storage**: Each DAO operates independently with completely separate storage
- **Battle-tested**: Used by major protocols like Gnosis Safe and Uniswap

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
```
